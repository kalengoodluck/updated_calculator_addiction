              <p>Despite the hotly contested debate among critics and proponents, the internet and tech addiction is gaining worldwide acceptance. The World Health Organization will include "gaming disorder" in its new Classification of International Diseases revision in mid-2018. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM-5, a guide edited by the American Psychiatric Association used by physicians for diagnosis, recently added "internet addiction" to a class of disorders that warrants more research.</p>
              <p>Hilary Cash is the co-founder and Chief Clinical Officer of reSTART, a treatment center for those who may be video game, virtual reality or internet addicts. Almost all her patients are young men, said Dr. Cash.</p>
              <p>"Young adults in their 20s or teens, by the time they get to us, they have lost control,” said Dr. Cash. "They might rationally know i need to to study for their exam, but they lose all sense of time and they make the choice to indulge in the addictive craving."</p>
              <p>Despite its wide acceptance, the affliction is hotly contested among skeptics who assert there isn’t enough research to support the existence of internet addiction. "Internet Addiction" inclusion by the DSM-5 received criticism stating stating that addiction is viewed too broadly.</p>
              <p>"My own opinion is that the vast majority of people who have smartphones are mildly addicted,"said Dr. Cash. "If they don't have there smartphones, they make have to take two days to get adjusted. They are functional. Even though they are mildly addicted."</p>
              <p>While the question of internet addiction rages on, the question remains for internet users: is your compulsion to your smart phone or internet gaming debilitating? In other words, is it crippling you from living your life?</p>
              <p>Maybe it's time to taken an honest look at our relationship with the internet and reality.</p>
              <p>Check your hours one more time.</p>
